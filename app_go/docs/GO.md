# Why Go

Go was selected for the compiled language implementation because it is widely used in DevOps and cloud-native environments.

## Advantages

- Compiles into a single static binary
- Very fast startup time
- Low memory usage
- Excellent support for containers and Kubernetes

Go binaries are ideal for multi-stage Docker builds where the final image contains only the compiled binary.
